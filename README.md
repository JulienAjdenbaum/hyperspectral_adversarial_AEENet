# Remote sensing - AAENET

This repository contains our code for our remote sensing project about Adversarial Autoencoder Network.

The real data are in the folders jasper and samson, the code to segment them is in Entropy-rate-superpixel-segmentation.

Our implementation of the networks, as well as our experiments on both synthetic and real data are in the folder AAENet, and especially ni the notebook AAENet.ipynb.
